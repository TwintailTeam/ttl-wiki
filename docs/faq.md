Common questions and answers about Twintail Launcher.

## General Questions

### What is Twintail Launcher?

Twintail Launcher (TTL) is a multi-platform launcher that brings mod support, quality-of-life improvements, and advanced features to anime-styled games. It serves as an all-in-one tool for downloading, managing, and launching your favorite anime games.

### Is Twintail Launcher free?

## Safety & Security

### Is TTL safe to use? Can I get banned?

We do our best to ensure the launcher avoids detection and doesn't interfere with sensitive files or anti-cheat systems. However, some games require the launcher to disable anti-cheat to function properly (Linux only). 

**Always use TTL at your own risk.** While we work hard to maintain safety, there's always potential risk when using third-party launchers with online games.

TTL primarily works as a launcher. It never touches game files.
