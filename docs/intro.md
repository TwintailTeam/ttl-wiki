# Welcome to Twintail Launcher

**Twintail Launcher (TTL)** is a multi-platform launcher that brings mod support, quality-of-life improvements, and advanced features to a variety of anime-styled games.

TTL is an all-in-one tool for downloading, managing, and launching your favorite anime games. It's designed with flexibility, ease of use, and customization in mind.

:::warning Use at Your Own Risk
We do our best to ensure the launcher avoids detection and doesn't interfere with sensitive files or anti-cheat systems. However, some games require the Launcher to disable the anti-cheat to get them running (Linux only). **Use TTL at your own risk.**
