# Safety & Security Guide

Important information about using Twintail Launcher safely and securely.

## Understanding the Risks

### General Risk Statement

⚠️ **Use Twintail Launcher at your own risk.** While we work hard to ensure TTL is safe and avoids detection, there's always potential risk when using third-party launchers with online games.

### What We Do to Stay Safe

The TTL team takes several measures to minimize risks:

- **Avoid Anti-Cheat Interference** - TTL is designed to work around, not interfere with, game anti-cheat systems
- **No Sensitive File Modification** - We avoid modifying game files of installed games
- **Regular Updates** - We continuously update TTL to maintain compatibility and safety
- **Community Testing** - Our community helps test and report any issues

## Platform-Specific Considerations

### Windows Users

- TTL works alongside Windows Defender and other security software
- Installation through Winget ensures you get verified, authentic releases
- No additional anti-cheat modifications required

### Linux Users

- **Important**: Some games may require disabling anti-cheat systems to function on Linux
- This is a Linux gaming limitation, not specific to TTL
- Consider the implications before proceeding with anti-cheat disabled games

## Best Practices

### Before Using TTL

1. **Backup Your Game Data** - Always backup your game saves and settings

### While Using TTL

2. **Monitor Official Announcements** - Stay informed about game updates that might affect TTL
3. **Report Issues** - Help the community by reporting any problems on [GitHub](https://github.com/TwintailTeam/TwintailLauncher/issues)
4. **Use Responsibly** - Don't use TTL for cheating or gaining unfair advantages

### If You Encounter Issues

1. **Stop Using TTL** - If you suspect detection or issues, stop using the launcher immediately
2. **Check Official Channels** - Look for announcements on TTL Discord server
3. **Revert to Official Launchers** - Switch back to official game launchers if needed
4. **Document and Report** - Help others by documenting your experience

## Account Security

### Protecting Your Accounts

- **Use Strong Passwords** - Always use unique, strong passwords for your game accounts
